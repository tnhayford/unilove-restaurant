Note
All API Endpoints are live and only requests from whitelisted IP(s) can reach these endpoints shared in this reference.

Requests from IP addresses that have not been whitelisted will return a 403 Forbidden error response or a timeout.

We permit a maximum of 4 IP addresses per service.


Understanding the Service Flow
The Hubtel Sales API allows you to integrate multiple functionalities into your applications. This document focuses on:

Direct Receive Money API: REST API to receive money directly into your Hubtel Merchant Account from a Mobile Money Wallet for all available networks.
Transaction Status Check API: REST API to check for the status of any debit transaction initiated after five (5) or more minutes of the debit transaction’s completion. It is mandatory to implement the Transaction Status Check API only for transactions that you do not receive a callback from Hubtel.
The entire process is asynchronous. The figure below demonstrates the service flow using these two endpoints:

Service Flow

The table below describes the steps involved in Receiving Money using the API:

Step	Description
1	Client App makes a Receive Money request to Hubtel.
2	Hubtel performs authentication on the request and sends a response to Client App accordingly.
3	A final callback is sent to Client App via the PrimaryCallbackURL provided in the request. (See sample callback here)
4	In instances where a merchant does not receive the final status of the transaction after five (5) minutes from Hubtel, it is mandatory to perform a status check using the Status Check API to determine the final status of the transaction. (Refer here)

Receive Money Callback
The Hubtel Receive Money API mandatorily sends a payload to the callbackURL provided in each request. The callback payload determines final status of a pending transaction response i.e.; transaction with 0001 ResponseCode. The callback URL you specified in the Receive Money request should be implemented to listen for an HTTP POST payload from Hubtel.

To process a Receive Money request, customer approval is required to transfer money from their mobile money account to your Hubtel Merchant Account. Consequently, the transaction flow is asynchronous. This means the final status of a transaction is not immediately available and may take up to 30 seconds to be confirmed. Therefore, it is crucial to implement an HTTP callback on your server to receive the final transaction status.

Transaction Status Check
It is mandatory to implement the Transaction Status Check API as it allows merchants to check for the status of a transaction in rare instances where a merchant does not receive the final status of the transaction from Hubtel after five (5) minutes.

To check the status of a transaction, send an HTTP GET request to the below URL, with either one or more unique transaction identifiers as parameters.

It is also mandatory to parse your POS Sales ID for Status Check requests in the endpoint. Find your POS Sales ID here.

bulb-icon
Note
Only requests from whitelisted IP(s) can reach the endpoint. Requests from IP addresses that have not been whitelisted will return a 403 Forbidden error response or a timeout. Submit your public IP(s) to your Retail Systems Engineer to be whitelisted.
