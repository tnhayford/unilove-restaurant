API Documentation
Last updated February 11th, 2026

Overview
The Hubtel Programmable Services API is designed to serve as a medium through which services being offered by businesses are made available for customers to purchase on the Hubtel platform via USSD, Hubtel App and the Web Mall.

With a single integration, services will be available for purchase on the:

USSD
Hubtel App on Android and iOS
Webstore
This makes it easier for businesses to reach a range of customers with their services.

How the API works

How to integrate the API
To integrate the Programmable Services API, follow these three simple steps:

Develop a USSD application.
Using the Programmable Services API Reference here, develop and host your application.

Add your service to your Hubtel account
To add your service, click here and provide your service interaction and service fulfilment URLs. Scroll down for further clarification on these URLs.

Link to USSD code
After adding the service, request a USSD code and attach the service you have created to the code.

Note
Attaching the service to the USSD code can only be done on the Merchant Dashboard.


Core Features Of The Programmable Services API
Screenshot

The Hubtel Programmable Services API interacts with your hosted app with two key functionalities designed to provide customers with the best user experience:

Service Interaction URL: Allows users to interact dynamically with your service application based on your own pre-designed flows.
Service Fulfilment URL: This URL is where requests are sent to, for the fulfilment of the service value after the user has made payment for the transaction.

Business IP Whitelisting
You must share your public IP address with your Retail System Engineer for whitelisting.

bulb-icon
Note
The service fulfillment callback endpoint is not public hence an IP whitelisting will be required before you can send a service fulfillment callback to Hubtel.

Also, Businesses seeking to add an extra layer of security to their service fulfillment payloads from Hubtel can whitelist Hubtel’s service fulfillment IP addresses: 52.50.116.54, 18.202.122.131, 52.31.15.68.


API Reference
The Hubtel Programmable Services API pushes service requests to the service URLs you specify for that service in your Hubtel Account.

Your application will need to respond to the Push Service Request which has been outlined in the reference below. Please see the expected response below.


PUSH REQUEST
This is the request which Hubtel will send to your Service Interaction URL when a user dials your USSD code or selects your service on the Hubtel App or Web Mall.


Parameter	Type	Description
Type	String	This stipulates the type of G.S request. Possible values are: “Initiation” – Indicates the beginning of a session (first message in the session). “Response” – indicates the subsequent response in an already existing session. “Timeout” – indicates that the session was cancelled by the user.
Message	String	Represents the actual text entered by the User. For USSD Channels, this will represent the USSD string entered by the subscriber during initiation.
ServiceCode	String	This represents either the USSD shortcode dialed. eg: "711*2".
Operator	String	This indicates the network operator of the user. Possible values are: "tigo", "airtel", "mtn", "vodafone".

Transaction Status Check
It is mandatory to implement the Transaction Status Check API as it allows merchants to check for the status of a transaction in rare instances where a merchant does not receive the final status of the transaction from Hubtel after five (5) minutes.

To check the status of a transaction, send an HTTP GET request to the below URL, with either one or more unique transaction identifiers as parameters.

It is also mandatory to parse your POS Sales ID for Status Check requests in the endpoint. Find your POS Sales ID here.

bulb-icon
Note
Only requests from whitelisted IP(s) can reach the endpoint. Submit your public IP(s) to your Retail Systems Engineer to be whitelisted.
